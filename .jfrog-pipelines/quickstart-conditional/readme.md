Conditional workflow in Pipelines enables you to choose if a step executes or skips based on certain conditions set for the previous upstream step. This means, when the workflow reaches a conditional step, it can choose different workflow paths based on the stepâ€™s status. This provides more flexibility in the execution logic of a pipeline.
